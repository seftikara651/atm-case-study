## Feature Checklists

## Additional Information

- Some part of these codes are intentionally made error, and contain bugs; you are REQUIRED to fix these
- It is RECOMMENDED to use advanced Java features and coding method, to get better points; for example: OOP, collection stream, proper data type, SOLID, modularism, etc.
- Beautification of the output SHALL NOT have bonus points, so you SHOULD focus on implementing features instead
- This project SHALL NOT connect to database at this point, so you MUST implement data store on underlying `data.repository` package
